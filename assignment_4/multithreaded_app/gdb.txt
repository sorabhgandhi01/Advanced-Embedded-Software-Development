Debugging with GDB
Bugs happen. Identifying and fixing them is part of the development process. There are
many different techniques for finding and characterizing program defects, including static
and dynamic analysis, code review, tracing, profiling, and interactive debugging. I will look
at tracers and profilers in the next chapter, but here I want to concentrate on the traditional
approach of watching code execution through a debugger, which in our case is the GNU
Project Debugger (GDB). GDB is a powerful and flexible tool. You can use it to debug
applications, examine the postmortem files (core files) that are created after a program
crash, and even step through kernel code.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
The GNU debugger
Preparing to debug
Debugging applications
Just-in-time debugging
Debugging forks and threads
Core files
GDB user interfaces
Debugging kernel code
The GNU debugger
GDB is a source-level debugger for compiled languages, primarily C and C++, although
there is also support for a variety of other languages such as Go and Objective-C. You
should read the notes for the version of GDB you are using to find out the current status of
support for the various languages.
Debugging with GDB
[ 357 ]
The project website is http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb and it contains a lot of useful
information, including the GDB User Manual, Debugging with GDB.
Out of the box, GDB has a command-line user interface, which some people find offputting,
although in reality, it is easy to use with a little practice. If command-line interfaces
are not to your liking, there are plenty of front-end user interfaces to GDB, and I will
describe three of them later.
Preparing to debug
You need to compile the code you want to debug with debug symbols. GCC offers two
options for this: -g and -ggdb. The latter adds debug information that is specific to GDB,
whereas the former generates information in an appropriate format for whichever target
operating system you are using, making it the more portable option. In our particular case,
the target operating system is always Linux, and it makes little difference whether you use
-g or -ggdb. Of more interest is the fact that both options allow you to specify the level of
debug information, from 0 to 3:
0: This produces no debug information at all and is equivalent to omitting the -g
or -ggdb switch
1: This produces minimal information, but which includes function names and
external variables, which is enough to generate a backtrace
2: This is the default and includes information about local variables and line
numbers so that you can perform source-level debugging and single-step through
the code
3: This includes extra information which, among other things, means that GDB
can handle macro expansions correctly
In most cases, -g suffices: reserve -g3 or -ggdb3 for if you are having problems stepping
through code, especially if it contains macros.
The next issue to consider is the level of code optimization. Compiler optimization tends to
destroy the relationship between lines of source code and machine code, which makes
stepping through the source unpredictable. If you experience problems like this, you will
most likely need to compile without optimization, leaving out the -O compile switch, or
using -Og, which enables optimizations that do not interfere with debugging.
Debugging with GDB
[ 358 ]
A related issue is that of stack-frame pointers, which are needed by GDB to generate a
backtrace of function calls up to the current one. On some architectures, GCC will not
generate stack-frame pointers with the higher levels of optimization (-O2 and above). If you
find yourself in the situation that you really have to compile with -O2 but still want
backtraces, you can override the default behavior with -fno-omit-frame-pointer. Also
look out for code that has been hand-optimized to leave out frame pointers through the
addition of -fomit-frame-pointer: you may want to temporarily remove those bits.
Debugging applications
You can use GDB to debug applications in one of two ways: if you are developing code to
run on desktops and servers, or indeed any environment where you compile and run the
code on the same machine, it is natural to run GDB natively. However, most embedded
development is done using a cross toolchain, and hence you want to debug code running on
the device but control it from the cross-development environment, where you have the
source code and the tools. I will focus on the latter case since it is the most likely scenario
for embedded developers, but I will also show you how to set up a system for native
debugging. I am not going to describe the basics of using GDB here since there are many
good references on that topic already, including the GDB user manual and the suggested
Further reading at the end of the chapter.
Remote debugging using gdbserver
The key component for remote debugging is the debug agent, gdbserver, which runs on the
target and controls execution of the program being debugged. gdbserver connects to a copy
of GDB running on the host machine via a network connection or a serial interface.
Debugging through gdbserver is almost, but not quite, the same as debugging natively. The
differences are mostly centered around the fact that there are two computers involved and
they have to be in the right state for debugging to take place. Here are some things to look
out for:
At the start of a debug session, you need to load the program you want to debug
on the target using gdbserver, and then separately load GDB from your cross
toolchain on the host.
GDB and gdbserver need to connect to each other before a debug session can
begin.
GDB, running on the host, needs to be told where to look for debug symbols and
source code, especially for shared libraries.
Debugging with GDB
[ 359 ]
The GDB run command does not work as expected.
gdbserver will terminate when the debug session ends, and you will need to
restart it if you want another debug session.
You need debug symbols and source code for the binaries you want to debug on
the host, but not on the target. Often, there is not enough storage space for them
on the target, and they will need to be stripped before deploying to the target.
The GDB/gdbserver combination does not support all the features of natively
running GDB: for example, gdbserver cannot follow the child process after a
fork, whereas native GDB can.
Odd things can happen if GDB and gdbserver are of different versions, or are the
same version but configured differently. Ideally, they should be built from the
same source using your favorite build tool.
Debug symbols increase the size of executables dramatically, sometimes by a factor of 10.
As mentioned in Chapter 5, Building a Root Filesystem, it can be useful to remove debug
symbols without recompiling everything. The tool for the job is strip from your cross
toolchain. You can control the aggressiveness of strip with these switches:
--strip-all: This removes all symbols (default)
--strip-unneeded: This removes symbols not needed for relocation processing
--strip-debug: This removes only debug symbols
For applications and shared libraries, --strip-all (the default) is fine,
but when it comes to kernel modules, you will find that it will stop the
module from loading. Use --strip-unneeded instead. I am still working
on a use case for â€“strip-debug.
With that in mind, let's look at the specifics involved in debugging with the Yocto Project
and Buildroot.
Setting up the Yocto Project for remote
debugging
There are two things to be done to debug applications remotely when using the Yocto
Project: you need to add gdbserver to the target image, and you need to create an SDK that
includes GDB and has debug symbols for the executables that you plan to debug.
Debugging with GDB
[ 360 ]
First, then, to include gdbserver in the target image, you can add the package explicitly by
adding this to conf/local.conf:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " gdbserver"
Alternatively, you can add tools-debug to EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES, which will add
gdbserver, native gdb, and strace to the target image (I will talk about strace in the next
chapter):
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks tools-debug"
For the second part, you just need to build an SDK as I described in Chapter 6, Selecting a
Build System:
$ bitbake -c populate_sdk <image>
The SDK contains a copy of GDB. It also contains a sysroot for the target with debug
symbols for all the programs and libraries that are part of the target image. Finally, the SDK
contains the source code for the executables. For example, looking at an SDK built for the
BeagleBone Black and generated by version 2.2.1 of the Yocto Project, it is installed by
default into /opt/poky/2.2.1/. The sysroot for the target is
/opt/poky/2.2.1/sysroots/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/. The
programs are in /bin/, /sbin/, /usr/bin/ and /usr/sbin/, relative to the sysroot, and
the libraries are in /lib/ and /usr/lib/. In each of these directories, you will find a
subdirectory named .debug/ that contains the symbols for each program and library. GDB
knows to look in .debug/ when searching for symbol information. The source code for the
executables is stored in /usr/src/debug/, relative to the sysroot.
Setting up Buildroot for remote debugging
Buildroot does not make a distinction between the build environment and that used for
application development: there is no SDK. Assuming that you are using the Buildroot
internal toolchain, you need to enable these options to build the cross GDB for the host and
to build gdbserver for the target:
BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_GDB, in Toolchain | Build cross gdb for the host
BR2_PACKAGE_GDB, in Target packages | Debugging, profiling and
benchmark->gdb
BR2_PACKAGE_GDB_SERVER, in Target packages | Debugging, profiling and
benchmark | gdbserver
Debugging with GDB
[ 361 ]
You also need to build executables with debug symbols, for which you need to enable
BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG, in Build options | build packages with debugging symbols.
This will create libraries with debug symbols in output/host/usr/<arch>/sysroot.
Starting to debug
Now that you have gdbserver installed on the target and a cross GDB on the host, you can
start a debug session.
Connecting GDB and gdbserver
The connection between GDB and gdbserver can be through a network or serial interface. In
the case of a network connection, you launch gdbserver with the TCP port number to listen
on and, optionally, an IP address to accept connections from. In most cases, you don't care
which IP address is going to connect, so you can just provide the port number. In this
example, gdbserver waits for a connection on port 10000 from any host:
# gdbserver :10000 ./hello-world
Process hello-world created; pid = 103
Listening on port 10000
Next, start the copy of GDB from your toolchain, pointing it at an unstripped copy of the
program so that GDB can load the symbol table:
$ arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gdb hello-world
In GDB, use the command target remote to make the connection to gdbserver, giving it
the IP address or hostname of the target and the port it is waiting on:
(gdb) target remote 192.168.1.101:10000
When gdbserver sees the connection from the host, it prints the following:
Remote debugging from host 192.168.1.1
The procedure is similar for a serial connection. On the target, you tell gdbserver which
serial port to use:
# gdbserver /dev/ttyO0 ./hello-world
Debugging with GDB
[ 362 ]
You may need to configure the port baud rate beforehand using stty(1) or a similar
program. A simple example would be as follows:
# stty -F /dev/ttyO0 115200
There are many other options to stty, so read the manual page for more details. It is
worthwhile noting that the port must not be being used for anything else. For example, you
can't use a port that is being used as the system console.
On the host, you make the connection to gdbserver using target remote plus the serial
device at the host end of the cable. In most cases, you will want to set the baud rate of the
host serial port first, using the GDB command set serial baud:
(gdb) set serial baud 115200
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyUSB0
Setting the sysroot
GDB needs to know where to find debug information and source code for the program and
shared libraries you are debugging. When debugging natively, the paths are well known
and built in to GDB, but when using a cross toolchain, GDB has no way to guess where the
root of the target filesystem is. You have to give it this information.
If you built your application using the Yocto Project SDK, the sysroot is within the SDK,
and so you can set it in GDB like this:
(gdb) set sysroot /opt/poky/2.2.1/sysroots/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linuxgnueabi
If you are using Buildroot, you will find that the sysroot is in
output/host/usr/<toolchain>/sysroot, and that there is a symbolic link to it in
output/staging. So, for Buildroot, you would set the sysroot like this:
(gdb) set sysroot /home/chris/buildroot/output/staging
GDB also needs to find the source code for the files you are debugging. GDB has a search
path for source files, which you can see using the command show directories:
(gdb) show directories
Source directories searched: $cdir:$cwd
Debugging with GDB
[ 363 ]
These are the defaults: $cwd is the current working directory of the GDB instance running
on the host; $cdir is the directory where the source was compiled. The latter is encoded
into the object files with the tag DW_AT_comp_dir. You can see these tags using objdump -
-dwarf, like this, for example:
$ arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-objdump --dwarf ./helloworld | grep DW_AT_comp_dir
[...]
<160> DW_AT_comp_dir : (indirect string, offset: 0x244):
/home/chris/helloworld
[...]
In most cases, the defaults, $cdir:$cwd, are sufficient, but problems arise if the directories
have been moved between compilation and debugging. One such case occurs with the
Yocto Project. Taking a deeper look at the DW_AT_comp_dir tags for a program compiled
using the Yocto Project SDK, you may notice this:
$ arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-objdump --dwarf ./helloworld | grep DW_AT_comp_dir
<2f> DW_AT_comp_dir : /usr/src/debug/glibc/2.24-r0/git/csu
<79> DW_AT_comp_dir : (indirect string, offset: 0x139):
/usr/src/debug/glibc/2.24-r0/git/csu
<116> DW_AT_comp_dir : /usr/src/debug/glibc/2.24-r0/git/csu
<160> DW_AT_comp_dir : (indirect string, offset: 0x244):
/home/chris/helloworld
[...]
Here, you can see multiple references to the directory /usr/src/debug/glibc/2.24-
r0/git, but where is it? The answer is that it is in the sysroot for the SDK, so the full path
is /opt/poky/2.2.1/sysroots/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linuxgnueabi/
usr/src/debug/glibc/2.24-r0/git. The SDK contains source code for all of
the programs and libraries that are in the target image. GDB has a simple way to cope with
an entire directory tree being moved like this: substitute-path. So, when debugging
with the Yocto Project SDK, you need to use these commands:
(gdb) set sysroot /opt/poky/2.2.1/sysroots/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linuxgnueabi
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/debug
/opt/poky/2.2.1/sysroots/cortexa8hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/usr/src/debug
You may have additional shared libraries that are stored outside the sysroot. In that case,
you can use set solib-search-path, which can contain a colon-separated list of
directories to search for shared libraries. GDB searches solib-search-path only if it
cannot find the binary in the sysroot.
Debugging with GDB
[ 364 ]
A third way of telling GDB where to look for source code, for both libraries and programs,
is using the directory command:
(gdb) directory /home/chris/MELP/src/lib_mylib
Source directories searched: /home/chris/MELP/src/lib_mylib:$cdir:$cwd
Paths added in this way take precedence because they are searched before those from
sysroot or solib-search-path.
GDB command files
There are some things that you need to do each time you run GDB, for example, setting the
sysroot. It is convenient to put such commands into a command file and run them each
time GDB is started. GDB reads commands from $HOME/.gdbinit, then from .gdbinit in
the current directory, and then from files specified on the command line with the -x
parameter. However, recent versions of GDB will refuse to load .gdbinit from the current
directory for security reasons. You can override that behavior for by adding a line like this
to your $HOME/.gdbinit:
set auto-load safe-path /
Alternatively, if you don't want to enable auto-loading globally, you can specify a particular
directory like this:
add-auto-load-safe-path /home/chris/myprog
My personal preference is to use the -x parameter to point to the command file, which
exposes the location of the file so that I don't forget about it.
To help you set up GDB, Buildroot creates a GDB command file containing the correct
sysroot command in output/staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit. It will contain
a line similar to this one:
set sysroot /home/chris/buildroot/output/host/usr/arm-buildroot-linuxgnueabi/
sysroot
Debugging with GDB
[ 365 ]
Overview of GDB commands
GDB has a great many commands, which are described in the online manual and in the
resources mentioned in the Further reading section. To help you get going as quickly as
possible, here is a list of the most commonly used commands. In most cases there, is a short
form for the command, which is listed in the tables following.
Breakpoints
These are the commands for managing breakpoints:
Command Short-form command Use
break <location> b <location> Set a breakpoint on a function name, line
number, or line. Examples of locations
are main, 5, and sortbug.c:42.
info breakpoints i b List breakpoints.
delete breakpoint
<N>
d b <N> Delete breakpoint <N>.
Running and stepping
These are commands for controlling the execution of a program:
Command Short-form
command
Use
run r Load a fresh copy of the program into memory and start
running it. This does not work for remote debug using gdbserver.
continue c Continue execution from a breakpoint.
Ctrl-C - Stop the program being debugged.
step s Step one line of code, stepping into any function that is called.
next n Step one line of code, stepping over a function call.
finish - Run until the current function returns.
Debugging with GDB
[ 366 ]
Getting information
These are commands for getting information about the debugger:
Command Short-form
command
Use
backtrace bt List the call stack
info threads i th Display information about the threads
executing in the program
info sharedlibrary i share Display information about shared libraries
currently loaded by the program
print <variable> p <variable> Print the value of a variable, for example
print foo
list l List lines of code around the current program
counter
Running to a breakpoint
Gdbserver loads the program into memory and sets a breakpoint at the first instruction,
then waits for a connection from GDB. When the connection is made, you enter into a
debug session. However, you will find that if you try to single-step immediately, you will
get this message:
Cannot find bounds of current function
This is because the program has been halted in code written in assembly which creates the
runtime environment for C and C++ programs. The first line of C or C++ code is the main()
function. Supposing that you want to stop at main(), you would set a breakpoint there and
then use the continue command (abbreviation c) to tell gdbserver to continue from the
breakpoint at the start of the program and stop at main():
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xbefffe24) at helloworld.c:8
printf("Hello, world!\n");
(gdb) c
At this point, you may see the following:
Reading /lib/ld-linux.so.3 from remote target...
warning: File transfers from remote targets can be slow. Use "set sysroot"
to access files locally instead.
Debugging with GDB
[ 367 ]
With older versions of GDB, you may instead see this:
warning: Could not load shared library symbols for 2 libraries, e.g.
/lib/libc.so.6.
In both cases, the problem is that you have forgotten to set the sysroot! Take another look
at the earlier section on sysroot.
This is all very different to starting a program natively, where you just type run. In fact, if
you try typing run in a remote debug session, you will either see a message saying that the
remote target does not support the run command, or in older versions of GDB, it will just
hang without any explanation.
Native debugging
Running a native copy of GDB on the target is not as common as doing it remotely, but it is
possible. As well as installing GDB in the target image, you will also need unstripped copies
of the executables you want to debug and the corresponding source code installed in the
target image. Both the Yocto Project and Buildroot allow you to do this.
While native debugging is not a common activity for embedded
developers, running profile and trace tools on the target is very common.
These tools usually work best if you have unstripped binaries and source
code on the target, which is half of the story I am telling here. I will return
to the topic in the next chapter.
The Yocto Project
To begin with, you need to add gdb to the target image by adding this to
conf/local.conf:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " gdb"
Next, you need the debug information for the packages you want to debug. The Yocto
Project builds debug variants of packages, which contain unstripped binaries and the
source code. You can add these debug packages selectively to your target image by adding
<package name>-dbg to your conf/local.conf. Alternatively, you can simply install all
debug packages by adding dbg-pkgs to EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES. Be warned that this will
increase the size of the target image dramatically, perhaps by several hundreds of
megabytes.
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "dbg-pkgs"
Debugging with GDB
[ 368 ]
The source code is installed into /usr/src/debug/<package name> in the target image.
This means that GDB will pick it up without needing to run set substitute-path. If you
don't need the source, you can prevent it from being installed by adding this to your
conf/local.conf file:
PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT_STYLE = "debug-without-src"
Buildroot
With Buildroot, you can tell it to install a native copy of GDB in the target image by
enabling this option:
BR2_PACKAGE_GDB_DEBUGGER in Target packages | Debugging, profiling and
benchmark | Full debugger
Then, to build binaries with debug information and to install them in the target image
without stripping, enable these two options:
BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG in Build options | Build packages with debugging
symbols
BR2_STRIP_none in Build options | Strip command for binaries on target
Just-in-time debugging
Sometimes a program will start to misbehave after it has been running for a while, and you
would like to know what it is doing. The GDB attach feature does exactly this. I call it justin-
time debugging. It is available with both native and remote debug sessions.
In the case of remote debugging, you need to find the PID of the process to be debugged
and pass it to gdbserver with the --attach option. For example, if the PID is 109, you
would type this:
# gdbserver --attach :10000 109
Attached; pid = 109
Listening on port 10000
Debugging with GDB
[ 369 ]
This forces the process to stop as if it were at a breakpoint, allowing you to start your cross
GDB in the normal way and connect to gdbserver. When you are done, you can detach,
allowing the program to continue running without the debugger:
(gdb) detach
Detaching from program: /home/chris/MELP/helloworld/helloworld, process 109
Ending remote debugging.
Debugging forks and threads
What happens when the program you are debugging forks? Does the debug session follow
the parent process or the child? This behavior is controlled by follow-fork-mode, which
may be parent or child, with parent being the default. Unfortunately, current versions of
gdbserver do not support this option, so it only works for native debugging. If you really
need to debug the child process while using gdbserver, a workaround is to modify the code
so that the child loops on a variable immediately after the fork, giving you the opportunity
to attach a new gdbserver session to it and then to set the variable so that it drops out of the
loop.
When a thread in a multi-threaded process hits a breakpoint, the default behavior is for all
threads to halt. In most cases, this is the best thing to do as it allows you to look at static
variables without them being changed by the other threads. When you recommence
execution of the thread, all the stopped threads start up, even if you are single-stepping,
and it is especially this last case that can cause problems. There is a way to modify the way
in which GDB handles stopped threads, through a parameter called scheduler-locking.
Normally it is off, but if you set it to on, only the thread that was stopped at the breakpoint
is resumed and the others remain stopped, giving you a chance to see what the thread alone
does without interference. This continues to be the case until you turn schedulerlocking
off. Gdbserver supports this feature.
Core files
Core files capture the state of a failing program at the point that it terminates. You don't
even have to be in the room with a debugger when the bug manifests itself. So, when you
see Segmentation fault (core dumped), don't shrug; investigate the core file and
extract the goldmine of information in there.
Debugging with GDB
[ 370 ]
The first observation is that core files are not created by default, but only when the core file
resource limit for the process is non-zero. You can change it for the current shell using
ulimit -c. To remove all limits on the size of core files, type the following command:
$ ulimit -c unlimited
By default, the core file is named core and is placed in the current working directory of the
process, which is the one pointed to by /proc/<PID>/cwd. There are a number of problems
with this scheme. Firstly, when looking at a device with several files named core, it is not
obvious which program generated each one. Secondly, the current working directory of the
process may well be in a read-only filesystem, there may not be enough space to store the
core file, or the process may not have permissions to write to the current working directory.
There are two files that control the naming and placement of core files. The first is
/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid. Writing a 1 to it causes the PID number of the dying
process to be appended to the filename, which is somewhat useful as long as you can
associate the PID number with a program name from log files.
Much more useful is /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, which gives you a lot more
control over core files. The default pattern is core, but you can change it to a pattern
composed of these meta characters:
%p: The PID
%u: The real UID of the dumped process
%g: The real GID of the dumped process
%s: The number of the signal causing the dump
%t: The time of dump, expressed as seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00
+0000 (UTC)
%h: The hostname
%e: The executable filename
%E: The path name of the executable, with slashes (/) replaced by exclamation
marks (!)
%c: The core file size soft resource limit of the dumped process
You can also use a pattern that begins with an absolute directory name so that all core files
are gathered together in one place. As an example, the following pattern puts all core files
into the directory /corefiles and names them with the program name and the time of the
crash:
# echo /corefiles/core.%e.%t > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
Debugging with GDB
[ 371 ]
Following a core dump, you would find something like this:
# ls /corefiles
core.sort-debug.1431425613
For more information, refer to the manual page core(5).
Using GDB to look at core files
Here is a sample GDB session looking at a core file:
$ arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gdb sort-debug
/home/chris/rootfs/corefiles/core.sort-debug.1431425613
[...]
Core was generated by `./sort-debug'.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0 0x000085c8 in addtree (p=0x0, w=0xbeac4c60 "the") at sort-debug.c:41
41 p->word = strdup (w);
That shows that the program stopped at line 41. The list command shows the code in the
vicinity:
(gdb) list
37 static struct tnode *addtree (struct tnode *p, char *w)
38 {
39 int cond;
40
41 p->word = strdup (w);
42 p->count = 1;
43 p->left = NULL;
44 p->right = NULL;
45
The backtrace command (shortened to bt) shows how we got to this point:
(gdb) bt
#0 0x000085c8 in addtree (p=0x0, w=0xbeac4c60 "the") at sort-debug.c:41
#1 0x00008798 in main (argc=1, argv=0xbeac4e24) at sort-debug.c:89
An obvious mistake: addtree() was called with a null pointer.
Debugging with GDB
[ 372 ]
GDB user interfaces
GDB is controlled at a low level through the GDB machine interface, GDB/MI, which can be
used to wrap GDB in a user interface or as part of a larger program, and it considerably
extends the range of options available to you.
In this section, I will describe three that are well suited to debugging embedded targets: the
Terminal user interface, TUI; the data display debugger, DDD; and the Eclipse Cdevelopment
Toolkit (CDT).
